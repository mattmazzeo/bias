# Stack Overview

Purpose: demonstrate a measurable transformation over 12 weeks via a multi-pathway peptide protocol while documenting safety, adherence, and outcomes suitable for investor and customer-facing narratives.

## Protocol window
- **Start:** Nov 25, 2024
- **End:** Feb 21, 2025 (Day 84)
- **Checkpoints:** Weekly reviews, mid-point labs (optional), end-point labs and DEXA.

## Compounds & focus areas
| Pathway | Compounds | Primary objectives | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Metabolic | Retatrutide (GLP-1/GIP/Glucagon) | Appetite control, fat loss, glycemic control | Titrate per tolerance; monitor GI and resting HR |
| GH Axis | Tesamorelin, CJC-1295 (no DAC), Ipamorelin | Lean mass preservation, recovery, sleep quality | Dose timing around sleep and training windows |
| Mitochondrial | NAD+, MOTS-c, SS-31 | Cellular energy, endurance, metabolic flexibility | Watch for flushing (NAD+) and energy shifts |
| Tissue Repair | BPC-157, TB-500, GHK-Cu, KPV | Gut integrity, soft tissue repair, skin/hair support, anti-inflammatory | Pair with rehab/mobility notes |
| Foundational | TRT (ongoing) | Hormonal baseline stability | Keep labs in range; note any dose changes |

## Measurement plan
- **Daily:** weight, Eight Sleep score/hours, steps/HRV/resting HR (Apple Health), subjective scores (energy, recovery, mental clarity, appetite), dose log, notable side effects/observations.
- **Weekly:** weight trend, averages (sleep, subjective), adherence rate, notable patterns, photo check (front/side/back), insight for next week.
- **Periodic:** Labs (baseline, mid if needed, final), DEXA (baseline, final), biological age testing.
- **Outputs:** Investor proof points, case study narrative, before/after summary.

## Responsibilities
- Keep **dosing_schedule.md** current for planned cadence.
- Record **titrations** the day they occur in **titration_log.md**.
- Align subjective observations with expected timelines in **reference/compound_mechanisms.md** and **reference/expected_timeline.md**.
