# Target Ranges (Reference)

Use these to interpret labs and guide adjustments. Default targets assume healthy, performance-oriented adult; customize with medical oversight.

## Metabolic
| Marker | Target | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fasting glucose | < 90 mg/dL | Prefer 80–89 if no hypoglycemia |
| Fasting insulin | < 5 uIU/mL | Lower supports HOMA-IR <1.0 |
| HbA1c | < 5.2 % | Track alongside CGM trends if available |
| HOMA-IR | < 1.0 | Use fasting glucose/insulin formula |

## Hormones
| Marker | Target | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Total Testosterone | Therapeutic range per clinician | Maintain stable TRT dosing |
| Free Testosterone | Mid-to-upper therapeutic | Watch SHBG changes |
| IGF-1 | Age-adjusted upper half | Adjust GH secretagogues accordingly |
| TSH | 0.5–2.0 µIU/mL | Interpret with Free T3/T4 |
| Free T3 | Upper half of lab range | Ensure adequate protein/micronutrients |
| Free T4 | Mid-range | |

## Inflammatory
| Marker | Target | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| hs-CRP | < 0.5 mg/L | Repeat if acutely ill |
| Homocysteine | < 7 µmol/L | Support with B vitamins if elevated |

## Lipids
| Marker | Target | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TG/HDL ratio | < 1.5 | Strong cardiometabolic indicator |
| ApoB | < 80 mg/dL | Prefer <70 if higher risk |
| Triglycerides | In range (contextual) | Check with fasting |
| HDL | In range (contextual) | Ratio matters more |

## Liver
| Marker | Target | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ALT | Within lab range | Watch with GLP-1/GH axis shifts |
| AST | Within lab range | Monitor with training load |
| GGT | Within lab range | Sensitive to alcohol/meds |

## Kidney
| Marker | Target | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BUN | Within lab range | Hydration-dependent |
| Creatinine | Within lab range | Consider muscle mass | 
| eGFR | > 90 | Use cystatin C if muscular |

## Other checkpoints
- **Biological age:** Aim for ≥2–5 year reduction by Day 84.
- **Resting HR:** Low-to-mid 50s if training allows; watch for GLP-1–related increases.
- **HRV:** Upward trend week-over-week; evaluate context (sleep, alcohol, travel).
