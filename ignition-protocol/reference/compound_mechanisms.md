# Compound Reference Cards

## Retatrutide (GLP-1/GIP/Glucagon)
- **Mechanism:** Triple incretin agonist dampening appetite, slowing gastric emptying, improving insulin sensitivity, and increasing energy expenditure via glucagon.
- **Expected timeline:** Appetite suppression within days; weight loss over weeks; metabolic marker shifts in 4–8 weeks.
- **Track:** Weight, appetite score, resting HR, GI tolerance, fasting glucose/insulin.
- **Synergies:** Pairs with GH axis peptides for lean mass preservation; dietary protein support.
- **Considerations:** Start low/go slow; watch nausea, hydration, and HR elevations.

## Tesamorelin
- **Mechanism:** GHRH analogue boosting GH release, reducing visceral adipose tissue, improving IGF-1.
- **Expected timeline:** Sleep/recovery changes in 1–2 weeks; visceral fat shifts over 8–12 weeks.
- **Track:** Sleep quality, waist/DEXA visceral fat, IGF-1, fasting glucose.
- **Synergies:** Works with Ipamorelin/CJC for pulsatile GH; align with sleep hygiene.
- **Considerations:** Dose away from food; monitor glucose and edema.

## CJC-1295 (no DAC)
- **Mechanism:** Short-acting GHRH analogue supporting pulsatile GH release.
- **Expected timeline:** Recovery/sleep subtle improvements in 1–2 weeks.
- **Track:** Sleep quality, recovery score, IGF-1 (with Tesamorelin context), morning heaviness/water.
- **Synergies:** Combine with Ipamorelin pre-bed; aligns with Tesamorelin for GH pulses.
- **Considerations:** Avoid carbs around dosing; rotate sites.

## Ipamorelin
- **Mechanism:** Ghrelin mimetic stimulating GH release with minimal appetite effect at typical doses.
- **Expected timeline:** Recovery and sleep quality within 1–2 weeks.
- **Track:** Sleep depth, DOMS, HRV, IGF-1 synergy effects.
- **Synergies:** Stack with CJC/Tesamorelin; peri-training for recovery support.
- **Considerations:** Avoid dosing close to carbs; monitor for headaches or flushing.

## NAD+
- **Mechanism:** Supports cellular redox and mitochondrial function; may enhance endurance and recovery.
- **Expected timeline:** Energy/mental clarity changes in days; endurance in 2–4 weeks.
- **Track:** Energy score, mental clarity, endurance notes, flushing/tolerability.
- **Synergies:** Align with MOTS-c/SS-31 for mitochondrial support.
- **Considerations:** Infusion rate affects comfort; hydrate well.

## MOTS-c
- **Mechanism:** Mitochondrial peptide enhancing metabolic flexibility, AMPK activation, and glucose utilization.
- **Expected timeline:** Endurance and glucose stability within 2–4 weeks.
- **Track:** Endurance, perceived exertion, fasting glucose, HRV under load.
- **Synergies:** With NAD+ and SS-31 for mitochondrial stack; with GLP-1 for metabolic control.
- **Considerations:** Morning dosing; note training-day responses.

## SS-31 (Elamipretide)
- **Mechanism:** Targets cardiolipin to improve mitochondrial efficiency and reduce oxidative stress.
- **Expected timeline:** Stamina and recovery improvements within 2–3 weeks.
- **Track:** Recovery, HRV trends, exertional fatigue, possible injection site reactions.
- **Synergies:** With MOTS-c and NAD+; supports endurance during caloric deficit.
- **Considerations:** Keep consistent timing; monitor for mild injection irritation.

## BPC-157
- **Mechanism:** Promotes angiogenesis and tissue repair; may support gut barrier integrity.
- **Expected timeline:** Local pain/soft tissue relief within days to weeks.
- **Track:** Pain scores, mobility, GI symptoms.
- **Synergies:** With TB-500 for connective tissue healing; pair with rehab exercises.
- **Considerations:** Target injections near affected areas when appropriate; note any GI relief.

## TB-500 (Thymosin Beta-4)
- **Mechanism:** Encourages cell migration and actin regulation to aid soft tissue repair and flexibility.
- **Expected timeline:** Mobility improvements over 2–4 weeks; injury recovery over 4–8 weeks.
- **Track:** Range of motion, pain, recovery time, training readiness.
- **Synergies:** With BPC-157 and structured rehab.
- **Considerations:** Loading then maintenance strategy; monitor for excessive fatigue.

## GHK-Cu
- **Mechanism:** Copper peptide supporting collagen synthesis, skin/hair health, and wound repair.
- **Expected timeline:** Skin tone/texture over 2–4 weeks; hair changes 6–12 weeks.
- **Track:** Skin quality, hair shedding/growth, topical tolerance.
- **Synergies:** With BPC-157 for tissue quality; adequate protein and minerals.
- **Considerations:** Watch for skin irritation (topical) or site reactions (SubQ).

## KPV
- **Mechanism:** Anti-inflammatory tripeptide (alpha-MSH fragment) modulating immune response and gut inflammation.
- **Expected timeline:** GI symptom relief within days; systemic inflammation shifts in weeks.
- **Track:** GI comfort, stool quality, hs-CRP if elevated.
- **Synergies:** With BPC-157 for gut repair; GLP-1 for appetite control.
- **Considerations:** Oral vs SubQ based on tolerance and goals.

## TRT
- **Mechanism:** Maintains physiological testosterone for energy, mood, body composition.
- **Expected timeline:** Stable benefits ongoing; labs quarterly.
- **Track:** Total/Free T, hematocrit, lipids, mood/libido.
- **Synergies:** Supports lean mass retention while in caloric deficit.
- **Considerations:** Monitor hematocrit, estradiol, and BP; keep dose stable unless medically adjusted.
