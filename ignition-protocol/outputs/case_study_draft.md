# Case Study Draft: Escape Velocity Peptides n=1

## The Starting Point
- Baseline metrics (weight, body composition, labs, biological age): 
- Context (founder role, goals, constraints): 
- Baseline photos: link to week-00 set.

## The Protocol (what, why, how)
- Overview of stack and rationale by pathway (metabolic, GH axis, mitochondrial, tissue repair, foundational).
- Dosing cadence highlights (link to `protocol/dosing_schedule.md`).
- Data sources: Withings, Apple Health, Eight Sleep, labs, DEXA, photos.

## The Journey (week-by-week)
- Summarize highlights from `data/weekly_summaries/` and `analysis/weekly_trends.md`.
- Call out adjustments (from `protocol/titration_log.md`).
- Mention adherence and any side-effect management.

## The Results
- Body composition: fat loss, lean mass preservation/gain, visceral fat change.
- Biological age shift.
- Key metabolic and hormone markers (before/after).
- Sleep/HRV and subjective quality-of-life trends.
- Visuals: before/after photos, DEXA charts.

## The Insight (for future customers)
- What worked best and why (peptide combos, timing, lifestyle anchors).
- What will be standardized in future cohorts.
- Safety and compliance learnings.

## Next steps
- How this informs the next Escape Velocity Peptides cohort.
- Planned follow-up metrics or maintenance protocol.
