# Expected Timeline

Use this to anticipate when effects should appear; compare against `analysis/weekly_trends.md` to validate.

## Weeks 1–2 (Days 1–14)
- Appetite suppression begins (Retatrutide); monitor GI.
- Sleep/recovery uptick from GH secretagogues (Tesamorelin/CJC/Ipamorelin).
- Early energy/clarity shifts from NAD+; mild endurance changes from MOTS-c start.
- Tissue repair peptides begin symptom relief (BPC-157); note mobility changes.

## Weeks 3–4 (Days 15–28)
- Weight loss trend should be visible (scale + waist); appetite control stabilizes.
- HRV and sleep depth improve if dosing/timing consistent.
- Endurance and glucose stability progress (MOTS-c, SS-31); adjust training intensity if needed.
- Skin/soft-tissue improvements begin (GHK-Cu, BPC-157, TB-500 early effects).

## Weeks 5–6 (Days 29–42)
- Metabolic markers may start shifting (fasting glucose/insulin, HOMA-IR) if labs drawn.
- Visceral fat reduction trajectory measurable by trend; prep for mid-point photos.
- Recovery robustness; evaluate adherence and titrate GLP-1 cautiously.

## Weeks 7–8 (Days 43–56)
- Endurance and mitochondrial benefits more pronounced; adjust caloric deficit if energy stable.
- Skin/hair changes more noticeable (GHK-Cu timeline).
- Consider optional mid-protocol labs for course correction.

## Weeks 9–10 (Days 57–70)
- Consolidate fat loss while preserving lean mass; GH axis steady-state.
- Watch for adaptation or plateau; tweak macros/training if needed.

## Weeks 11–12 (Days 71–84)
- Prepare final measurements: labs, DEXA scheduling, photo sets.
- Taper titrations; maintain adherence to lock in results.
- Draft investor proof points and case study content.

## Post-protocol (optional)
- Plan maintenance or taper strategy for GLP-1 and GH axis agents.
- Continue monitoring labs and HRV for 2–4 weeks post to ensure stability.
